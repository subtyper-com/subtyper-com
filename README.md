Thank you for your interest in www.SubTyper.com.

SubTyper makes a much needed correction in the way we have been communicating.

We take a multidimensional, verifiable set of factual relationships and crush them into a flat paragraph of text.  Then we use a thesaurus to call the same word different things in different places. Finally to make it 'interesting', we add anecdotes and some narative spin for an interpretation whose questionable truthfulness overshadows the facts used to derive it.

The audience then has to reverse this process to get the information they need.  First, they try to remove the narative spin. Then they figure out what different words are refering to the same things. And finally, they attempt to determine the precise set of relationships between these words, a feeble caricature of the author's intention.

Why not just pass the ojects and relationships?  This is the goal of SubTyper, to allow users to share and navigate the relationships between objects without the narative spin.

Please visit our site and let us know what you think about our approach.  We'd love to hear what you think.

Sincerely,
